A node.js websocket based web interface for controlling the GPIO outputs on a Raspberry Pi.

The websocket can be used to easily automate any I/O functions on the Pi.

The pinouts used in this example are based on the Pi 3 B+. The resources required are minimal, therefore just a Pi 1 is more than sufficient.
